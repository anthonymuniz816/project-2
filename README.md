Program Instructions:

1. Program runs and asks the user if they are a Professional or Non-Professional Employee.

2. User then inputs 1 or 0 depending on what they are.

3. If user is a Pro, program will ask for name and how many years they have worked for the company. Program will then output their monthly salary, the amount of money that went towards their health contributions and the amount of weeks they have for vacation this year.

4. If user is a Non-Pro, program will ask for name and how many hours they have worked for this week. Program will then output their weekly salary, the amount of money that went towards their health contributions and the amount of hours they have earned for vacation this year during that week.
